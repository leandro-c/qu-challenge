My name is Leandro Casarin.
I am a software developer since 2012.
I started as a backend in .NET following my path with Node.js to then enter the Javascript ecosystem.
I've done things with Angular 1, React and vanilla js with html.
Since 2017 I'm a React developer, and I've always been interested in Vue.js and the different frameworks and libraries that are coming out in the frontend world.
